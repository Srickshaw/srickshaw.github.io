			<p class="sd-body-text">This site, as it stands, is pretty much a blog. But, it's a bit more than that - or at least what I have in mind for it. It's a clean space for me to express my thoughts, my ideas, my beliefs about web design and development without any frills. I wanted it that way because that way, people can focus on the text, on what I'm saying, instead of being distracted by a million other things in the sidebars or the comments or anything of that nature.</p>
			<p class="sd-body-text">Think about it - even with Kindles and iPads and other tablets, when you read a book on them, they still do it the same way that real books are - stark, well-formatted and no frills. Because in books, the content is king, as it should be for any form of writing. Hence, since this is writing, I want people to focus on words.</p>
